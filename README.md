First time making an iOS app.

This is an app to simulate a scripted conversation technique in which you dig down into the roots your feelings surrounding an emotion or a feeling. (Like taking an elevator down to the bottom floor of the emotion).

This uses CoreData to save the conversations to the local device, and swiftUI for the interface. Swift understanding here is not very deep.
